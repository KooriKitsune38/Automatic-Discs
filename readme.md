# How To Use

Get the egg with:

> /function adiscs:give_jukebox

Then place it down (will remove itself once the jukebox is broken)

## Modes

### Container

Place a container (chest - barrel - shulker box) on top with the discs and it will shuffle between them once the song stops.

The order is from top left (first) to bottom right (last).

> Place anything other than discs and it might break

### Loot Table

Without a container on top, it will select a random disc from the loot table `adiscs:disc`.

To change it just add an entry. (Path: `data/adiscs/loot_tables/disc.json`)
